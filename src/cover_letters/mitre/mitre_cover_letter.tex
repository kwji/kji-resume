Dear Hiring Manager,
\\[\baselineskip]
I am writting to apply for a software engineering position. I heard about this position through my brother, Jason Ji, currently a software developer at MITRE.

I am currently a software developer with CGI Federal, working to implement the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (Healthcare.gov). For the past eight months, I have worked with multiple teams to implement critical back-end functionality and to improve system performance and stability. In the months leading up to the October release, I implemented a large scale content reprocessing function to extract insurance plan data from the Plan Management database and reprocess it into a consumable format for the financial managment system. This data is critical for computing cost share reduction values for each Healthcare.gov user. After the system went live, I joined the Plan Compare team to design and implement a new system-wide caching scheme which improved the average system response time from over 12 seconds to approximately 350 milliseconds. This also substantially reduced the average load on our database and improved the system failure rate. I also helped to resolve defects with and implement improvements for the rating engine component which is responsible for computing the elligible plans, monthly premiums, deductibles, and benefits which are displayed to the users while shopping for healthcare. In particular, I resolved a large number of high-profile defects including missing plans, and rates and deductibles computed incorrectly by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. 

I have enjoyed working on Healthcare.gov immensely. It has been tremendously exciting and phenomenal learning experience. However, because CGI Federal's contract for work on Heathcare.gov was not renewed by CMS, my future is now uncertain. My brother has told me a great deal about his software development work with MITRE and I am be extremely interested in joining MITRE.
